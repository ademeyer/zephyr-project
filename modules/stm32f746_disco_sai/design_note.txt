// Design Note
Note:
    - Implementation is based on Free protocol modes described in: https://www.st.com/resource/en/product_training/STM32F7_Peripheral_SAI.pdf
    - The STM32F7 has two SAI with FIFO buffer of 8 (x 32-bits) Samples each, with two interrups
      and DMA Interfaces.

        Implementation Knowledge Guide
---------------------------------------------------
* SAI SCK can be generated from:
    - The two PLL
    - I2S_CKIN pad
    - HSI or HSE (only on STM32H7)

* The Free protocol mode is configurable in:
    - I2S Philips Standard
    - I2S MSB-justified
    - LSB-justified
    - TDM
    - PDM

* Free protocol is used to adjust:
    - Data Justification
    - Data size, slot (or channel) size
    - Data position into slot
    - Sampling edge of the serial (sample at rising or falling edge of clock)
    - Frame size, Frame polarity, Frame period
    - Frame active level size
    - Frame Synchronization mode
    - Master / Slave mode
    - Single or Multiple or Full-duplex data lanes
